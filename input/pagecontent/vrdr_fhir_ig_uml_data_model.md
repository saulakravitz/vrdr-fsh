The [VRDR FHIR IG UML Data Model](http://www.hl7.org/documentcenter/public/wg/pher/Profile%20Structural%20Definitions.png) is a graphical representation of the VRDR FHIR IG resource profile structural definitions. The diagram uses the Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation wherein each class represents a resource profile, attributes represent constrained resource elements, and relationships represent directed references from one profile to another. The color scheme used for classes are based upon the partitioning of the IG into four profile groups.
