Terminology binding is part of process of preparing a resource profile specification. If the resource element is a codeable element the resource profile specifies the code system, code system term, or value set from which the allowable concepts for the resource element are drawn. The terminology binding can be to an entire code system - **Code System Binding (CS)**, a single code system term - **Fixed Value Binding (CST)**, or to a collection of code system terms - **Value Set Binding (VS)**.

The following table contains the teminology bindings for FHIR resource profile elements directly related to coded data items in the [U.S. Standard Certificate of Death](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/DEATH11-03final-ACC.pdf). A complete set of terminology bindings is included for each resource profile on their respective structure definition page.
